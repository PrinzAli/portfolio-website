          This project was part of my UX Design Course with CareerFoundry. The task was to create a scavenger hunt app that enables players to enjoy social scavenger hunts for real objects and locations in their own cities. Implementing my love for
          traveling and geocaching, I decided to create an application that gives users the possibility of exploring cities in a fun and entertaining way while providing the opportunity to create their own hunts.

        <h2> Research </h2>
        <p>
          Throughout this project, I applied the design thinking process in order to keep the users‘ needs in mind while creating the app. By starting the process with a focus on exploring the market and understanding the users‘ needs through user
          research, user personas and user journeys, I was able to develop ideas for the app that would actually meet the users’ needs and benefit them.
          Based on these learnings and first ideas, I began to visualize my app through the creation of low-, mid- and high-fidelity wireframes and prototypes. Being still early within the design process, I tested these prototypes via usability
          testing and was, therefore, able to identify any major problems or smaller barriers which were remedied in the following iterations of the product.
        </p>
        <p>
          The user personas helped me to ensure that the users’ motivation and - even more importantly - their pain points were not forgotten while I was working on the app. I created two personas based on the user interviews and the survey and
          referred back to them all the way through to the final
          prototype.

        <h2> Ideation </h2>
        <p>
          I looked forward to bring life to my ideas and wanted to start with the wire framing as soon as possible. To organize the content in my app, I started writing down sites and subsites I expected to be part of my app. To be sure that I
          include all necessary sites and in order to check if my idea of grouping works for other people as well, I conducted a card sorting test. A standardized grid and a similarity matrix revealed a general approval of my grouping within my
          target group. I went on with only small changes to set up my „final“ sitemap. As there are always iterations while working on the app, the sitemap, as well as the layouts of my wireframes, were not cast in stone. The version displayed here
          is the latest version though.

        <h2> Wireframe </h2>
        <p>
          Getting the sitemap done and starting with scribbling the first wireframes, seeing my ideas on paper for the first time felt great! I sketched my ideas based on the user flows I created before and after many drawings and different
          wireframe-versions was able to convert these important first sketches to a mid-fidelity prototype using Adobe XD.

        <h2> Design </h2>
        <p>
          It‘s getting serious - now was the point where the app came to life. The mid-fidelity wireframes turned into high-fidelity, I added pictures and a color palette and thought about how to design buttons and icons. This - not so UX - part of
          adding an Interface to my app was a very valuable lesson and I had a lot of fun doing it.
        </p>
        <p>
          I used preference tests to see how users would decide on certain details of my design such as the logo, the sign-up process or while creating a hunt.

          Below, you‘ll find a protoype of my app. Have fun with it and explore it, but keep in mind that it‘s far from complete. Nevertheless, it should give you a good feel for the app and what I intend with it. I am open to feedback and would love
          to hear what you think about it!

        <h1> What I learned </h1>
      </div>
      <div class="row">
        <p>
          A lot! The process was very intense and as I had no background in design, I was happy to learn some new things in this field, too. I learned that people are different - and that is good! Nevertheless, everyone has different pain points,
          opinions, and emotions when using a product. It is not possible to create an app that will be a complete dream of an app for everyone. It is possible though, to find solutions that make many users happy and it is always possible to
          improve. I am a big fan of the iterative process because it helps to find problems before I put too much work into a product. It is possible to focus on the important steps of a design process
          this way and have the users’ wishes in mind. I cannot wait to learn more. Do you have projects I can help you with and which will teach me even more? I am looking forward to your message!
